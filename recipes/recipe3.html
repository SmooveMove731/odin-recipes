 <h1>Watermelon Sangria Description and Ingredients!</h1>
 <p> 
    Sangria is a punch made with wine. It’s traditionally a red wine mixed with fresh fruit and juices. Sangria, as we know it, is from Spain. The first sip we got in the U.S. was a red sangria at the 1964 World’s Fair in the Spanish Pavilion. 
    I can only imagine that was the busiest pavilion! </p>
